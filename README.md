# Housing Dataset Analysis

## Internship Details

- **Name**: Kunal Thakur
- **Company**: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS
- **ID**: CT4ML5498
- **Domain**: Machine Learning
- **Duration**: July 20, 2024 - August 20, 2024
- **Mentor**: Muzammil Ahmed

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the California housing dataset to predict housing values based on various features. The dataset provides information about housing attributes in California and is used to train a Linear Regression model to estimate the median house value.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two CSV files:

1. **Training Data**: `california_housing_train.csv`
2. **Test Data**: `california_housing_test.csv`

### Training Data

- **longitude**: Longitude coordinate of the housing district.
- **latitude**: Latitude coordinate of the housing district.
- **housing_median_age**: Median age of houses in the district.
- **total_rooms**: Total number of rooms in the district.
- **total_bedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms in the district.
- **population**: Total population in the district.
- **households**: Total number of households in the district.
- **median_income**: Median income of the district.
- **median_house_value**: Median house value in the district (target variable).

### Test Data

The test data has the same structure as the training data but does not include the target variable `median_house_value`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Load the Data**

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   df = pd.read_csv('/content/sample_data/california_housing_train.csv')
   ```

2. **Data Exploration**

   Explore the data with summary statistics and visualizations.

   ```python
   df.info()
   df.describe()
   ```

   Visualize distributions and correlations:

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns

   for column in df.columns:
       plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
       plt.hist(df[column])
       plt.title(column)
       plt.show()

   correlation = df.corr()
   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
   sns.heatmap(correlation, annot=True)
   plt.show()
   ```

3. **Train the Model**

   Prepare the data and train a Linear Regression model.

   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

   lr = LinearRegression()
   x_train = df.drop(['median_house_value', 'longitude', 'latitude'], axis=1)
   y_train = df['median_house_value']
   lr.fit(x_train, y_train)
   ```

4. **Evaluate the Model**

   Load the test data and evaluate the model's performance.

   ```python
   df_test = pd.read_csv('/content/sample_data/california_housing_test.csv')
   x_test = df_test.drop(['median_house_value', 'longitude', 'latitude'], axis=1)
   y_test = df_test['median_house_value']
   score = lr.score(x_test, y_test) * 100
   print(f'Model Accuracy: {score:.2f}%')
   ```

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 54.59% on the test set.

## Notes

- The data has been preprocessed to remove `longitude` and `latitude` as features for training.
- The model's performance can be improved by experimenting with different feature selections or models.
